Hi, I’m @Rozario29

Graduated as a mechanical engineer, worked as a technical sales executive at ASSA ABLOY

Got fascinated with Excel sheets used for data exploration and thus was introduced to Data Analytics

I’m interested in data analytics, having completed a few courses on PostgreSQL , Tableau and Excel. Currently learning to build projects and leveraging them for a job role as a Junior Data Analyst.
